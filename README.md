# Unclosed Nested DIV Tag Bug in HTML

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic bug in HTML: an unclosed nested `div` tag. While seemingly minor, this can lead to unexpected layout and rendering behaviors, particularly in larger or more complex documents.  The bug is difficult to spot through visual inspection, requiring careful review of the HTML structure.

## Bug Description

A nested `div` element is improperly closed, which will cause the browser to interpret the remaining elements unexpectedly.  The exact effect depends on the browser and the surrounding HTML.  You might see unexpected spacing, content jumping around, or styling inconsistencies.
